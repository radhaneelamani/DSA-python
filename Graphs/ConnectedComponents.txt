Given an undirected graph with 10 nodes and 8 edges, as following:
(1,2), (1,3), (2, 4), (3, 4), (5,6), (6, 7), (5,7), (8,9)
So this is a graph which is in 4 pieces, called as connected components:
visualisation:

1 ----- 2
|       |         5             8
|       |       |   |           \         10
|       |      |     |           9
3 ----- 4      6     7   


This graph has been broken down into 4 different components of a single graph
